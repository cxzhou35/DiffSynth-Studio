PROMPT="In a brightly lit, modern room, an East Asian man wearing glasses and a grey hoodie speaks with a thoughtful expression, his hands clasped in front of him. The setting suggests a professional interview or video shoot, with a multi-camera rig visible on the right, contrasted by a comfortable environment featuring a large potted plant, a brick wall, and a large window looking out onto a sunny, green yard. The overall atmosphere is calm and focused, blending a professional production with a relaxed, naturalistic setting."
